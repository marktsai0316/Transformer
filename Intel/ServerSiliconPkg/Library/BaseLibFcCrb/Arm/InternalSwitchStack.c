  Transfers control to a function starting with a new stack.

  This internal worker function transfers control to the function
  specified by EntryPoint using the new stack specified by NewStack,

  Context1 and Context2 are optional and may be NULL.
  The function EntryPoint must never return.

  @param EntryPoint   The pointer to the function to enter.
  @param Context1     The first parameter to pass in.
  @param Context2     The second Parameter to pass in
  @param NewStack     The new Location of the stack
