/**
  Divides a 64-bit unsigned integer by a 32-bit unsigned integer and
  generates a 64-bit unsigned result and an optional 32-bit unsigned remainder.

  This function divides the 64-bit unsigned value Dividend by the 32-bit
  unsigned value Divisor and generates a 64-bit unsigned quotient. If Remainder
  is not NULL, then the 32-bit unsigned remainder is returned in Remainder.
  This function returns the 64-bit unsigned quotient.

  @param  Dividend  A 64-bit unsigned value.
  @param  Divisor   A 32-bit unsigned value.
  @param  Remainder A pointer to a 32-bit unsigned value. This parameter is
                    optional and may be NULL.

  @return Dividend / Divisor
